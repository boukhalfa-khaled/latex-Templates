\raggedright Dear Ahmed,\\

\vspace{0.7em}

My name is Boukhalfa Khaled Islam, and I recently graduated from Zian Achour Djelfa University, where I studied Web and Mobile Application Development and ranked first in my major. I am from Djelfa city, in the Djelfa Wilaya. I'm passionate about technology, especially Linux and Free and Open Source Software. I've been using Arch Linux as my primary system for nearly two years, and almost all my tools are open-source, running on the terminal—like Ranger, Vim, fzf, and tmux.

When it comes to programming, I’m more interested in understanding how things work under the hood rather than just following trends or frameworks. This summer, I started learning data structures, which I implemented in C. If you ask about my favorite language, I’d say C because it feels transparent; I can see how memory is allocated and how array indexing works when I write code.

In web development, I’m familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve built projects using PHP with Laravel, and I’ve also worked with Django and Django REST framework along with React.js during my internship. While I’ve touched on these languages and frameworks, I’m not yet an expert but have a solid foundation to build on.

During my internship, I learned the value of hard work and mentorship. I’m excited to further specialize and become proficient in a tech stack. Since I know your company uses Java and Spring Boot, I believe this will be the right direction for me because I’m fond of Java as a full-fledged programming language, unlike scripting languages like PHP or JavaScript.

I’m highly motivated to learn, grow, and contribute to your company as I begin my career. I look forward to the opportunity to join your team and develop my skills further.
